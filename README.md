# Caravan
## By Team Lend A Hand

People tend to come across many animals or people on
their way to work or school, that they would like to help
but cannot immediately, due to lack of time. Caravan is
an app that aims to make the community help each other
out, rather than relying on municipal corporations or
NGOs.

Caravan is designed like a social media application to allow
users to easily navigate within the app. Users can:
  - Share requests with details about the animal or person in
    need of help.
  - Browse othersâ€™ posts, use search filters and offer help.
  - Use the emergency feature in case of accidents, heart
    attacks, etc.

NGOs and Help Centers cannot always provide their
services in time, due to various reasons. By enabling the
community to solve issues internally, the dependence on
these services, and the chances of the problem getting
worse, is reduced.
